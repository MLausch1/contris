# Introduction #

This Document gives Information about Editing and Compiling the Source Code.


# Details #

First of all, the Source Code should be Compilable in .NET 2.0 under Visual Studio 2008 and newer.

You do not actually need to download the Source if you only want to Play the Game, since a compiled Version is available for Download.

The Source is splitted into 3 Files:

  * **program.cs**
> > This is the Main application Class and contains all the Logic used to access the Tetris and Block Library,it controls the Timing and Key Events
  * **clsBlock.cs**
> > This Class Contains the Blocks used in Tetris. You can add any Blocks of any Size you wish
  * **clsTetris.cs**
> > The Tetris Library itself has all Functions needed to Play Tetris. It takes care of the Tetris Field and Block Position
